While choosing the right\n\n        hosting services is not always a walk in the park, since marketers make every package\n        choice look attractive, a keener look can reveal contrasting differences. Currently,\n        the most popular hosting categories available are traditional single-server account\n        hosting and cloud hosting, which is increasingly redefining operational efficiencies.\n        Cloud web hosting primarily gains its distinction by eliminating the need to depend\n        on a single physical server and instead depends on an advanced electronic structure\n\n        where your website data is stored in multiple virtual resources. Traditional hosting,\n        on the other hand, refers to the standard approach where a website is hosted in a\n        single physical server which is also used to offer similar services to other sites.\n        Each of the hosting options comes with its own benefits, but cloud hosting gets the\n        upper hand because of the following factors.\n        The benefits of instant upgrading is a strength that cloud hosting for web resellers\n        will highly benefit from as they have sufficient resources to meet their current\n\n        demands. Reseller agencies work on demand, and as the number of their websites\n        increases, it becomes vital to have more CPU and RAM to support all the traffic\n        and data from the sites. In case of traditional hosting, any upgrade disrupts the\n        workflow and causes downtime, sometimes quite a prolonged one, which isn’t something\n        most website owners are happy about. Cloud hosting is not limited, and at a click of a\n        button, an upgrade is possible without the need for downtime or interrupting sites that\n        are currently running. This means that a hosting provider can easily upgrade its assets\n        without causing any inconveniences to its clients, providing smooth service – exactly what\n        they came for in the first place.\n      ")])])])}],s=(n("7f7f"),n("cadf"),n("551c"),n("097d"),n("bc3a")),o=n.n(s),r=n("0c12"),l={data:function(){return{file:null,title:"",downloaded:!1}},mounted:function(){var e=this;o.a.get("/api/files/".concat(this.$route.params.id)).then(function(t){var n=t.data;e.file=n,e.file.visitCount+=1,e.title="".concat(n.name," - ")}).catch(function(t){return console.log(t),500===t.response.status?r["a"].$emit("error","Server Error: Unable to handle the request now.
