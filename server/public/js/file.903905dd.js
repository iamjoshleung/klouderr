A truly\n        intersectional assemblage, representing both big business and big\n        money. But it’s the little guys they’re supposedly looking out for.\n        That is, all the companies that would have been affected by the latest\n        attempt at regulatory overreach: SB 1047. Imagine being charged for\n        improper open model disclosure! A16Z general partner Anjney Midha\n        called it a “regressive tax” on startups and “blatant regulatory\n        capture” by the Big Tech companies that could, unlike Midha and his\n        impoverished colleagues, afford the lawyers necessary to comply.\n        Except that was all disinformation promulgated by Andreessen Horowitz\n        and the other moneyed interests that might actually have been affected\n        as backers of billion-dollar enterprises. In fact, small models and\n        startups would have been only trivially affected because the proposed\n        law specifically protected them. It’s odd that the very type of\n        purposeful cutout for “Little Tech” that Horowitz and Andreessen\n        routinely champion was distorted and minimized by the lobbying\n        campaign they and others ran against SB 1047. (The architect of that\n        bill, California State Senator Scott Wiener, talked about this whole\n        thing recently at Disrupt.) That bill had its problems, but its\n        opposition vastly overstated the cost of compliance and failed to\n        meaningfully support claims that it would chill or burden startups.\n        It’s part of the established playbook that Big Tech — which, despite\n        their posturing, Andreessen and Horowitz are closely aligned with —\n        runs at the state level, where it can win (as with SB 1047), meanwhile\n        asking for federal solutions that it knows will never come, or which\n        will have no teeth due to partisan bickering and congressional\n        ineptitude on technical issues. This joint statement of “policy\n        opportunity” is the latter part of the play: after torpedoing SB 1047,\n        they can say they only did so with an eye to supporting a federal\n        policy. No matter that we are still waiting on the federal privacy law\n        that tech companies have pushed for a decade while fighting state\n        bills. And what policies do they support? “A variety of responsible\n        market-based approaches,” in other words: hands off our money, Uncle\n        Sam. Regulations should have “a science and standards-based approach\n        that recognizes regulatory frameworks that focus on the application\n        and misuse of technology,” and should “focus on the risk of bad actors\n        misusing AI.” What is meant by this is we shouldn’t have proactive\n        regulation, but instead reactive punishments when unregulated products\n        are used by criminals for criminal purposes. This approach worked\n        great for that whole FTX situation, so I can see why they espouse it.\n        “Regulation should be implemented only if its benefits outweigh its\n        costs.” It would take thousands of words to unpack all the ways this\n        idea, expressed so, in this context, is hilarious. But basically, what\n        they are suggesting is that the fox be brought in on the henhouse\n        planning committee. Regulators should “permit developers and startups\n        the flexibility to choose which AI models to use wherever they are\n        building solutions and not tilt the playing field to advantage any one\n        platform.” The implication is that there is some sort of plan to\n        require permission to use one model or another. Since that’s not the\n        case, this is a straw man. Here’s a big one that I have to just quote\n        in its entirety: The right to learn: copyright law is designed to\n        promote the progress of science and useful arts by extending\n        protections to publishers and authors to encourage them to bring new\n        works and knowledge to the public, but not at the expense of the\n        public’s right to learn from these works. Copyright law should not be\n        co-opted to imply that machines should be prevented from using data —\n        the foundation of AI — to learn in the same way as people. Knowledge\n        and unprotected facts, regardless of whether contained in protected\n        subject matter, should remain free and accessible. To be clear, the\n        explicit assertion here is that software, run by billion dollar\n        corporations, has the “right” to access any data because it should be\n        able to learn from it “in the same way as people.” First off, no.\n        These systems are not like people; they produce data that mimics human\n        output in their training data. They are complex statistical projection\n        software with a natural language interface. They have no more “right”\n        to any document or fact than Excel. Second, this idea that “facts” —\n        by which they mean “intellectual property” — are the only thing these\n        systems are interested in and that some kind of fact-hoarding cabal is\n        working to prevent them is an engineered narrative we have seen\n        before. Perplexity has invoked the “facts belong to everyone” argument\n        in its public response to being sued for alleged systematic content\n        theft, and its CEO Aravind Srinivas repeated the fallacy to me on\n        stage at Disrupt, as if they are being sued over knowing trivia like\n        the distance from the Earth to the Moon. While this is not the place\n        to embark on a full accounting of this particular straw man argument,\n        let me simply point out that while facts are indeed free agents, the\n        way they are created — say, through original reporting and scientific\n        research — involves real costs. That is why the copyright and patent\n        systems exist: not to prevent intellectual property from being shared\n        and used widely, but to incentivize its creation by ensuring that they\n        can be assigned real value. Copyright law is far from perfect and is\n        probably abused as much as it is used. But it is not being “co-opted\n        to imply that machines should be prevented from using data” — it is\n        being applied to ensure that bad actors do not circumvent the systems\n        of value that we have built around intellectual property. That is\n        quite clearly the ask: let the systems we own and run and profit from\n        freely use the valuable output of others without compensation. To be\n        fair, that part is “in the same way as humans,” because it is humans\n        who design, direct, and deploy these systems, and those humans don’t\n        want to pay for anything they don’t have to, and don’t want\n        regulations to change that. There are plenty of other recommendations\n        in this little policy document, which are no doubt given greater\n        detail in the versions they’ve sent directly to lawmakers and\n        regulators through official lobbying channels. Some ideas are\n        undoubtedly good, if also a little self-serving: “fund digital\n        literacy programs that help people understand how to use AI tools to\n        create and access information.” Good! Of course, the authors are\n        heavily invested in those tools. Support “Open Data Commons—pools of\n        accessible data that would be managed in the public’s interest.”\n        Great! “Examine its procurement practices to enable more startups to\n        sell technology to the government.” Awesome! But these more general,\n        positive recommendations are the kind of thing you see every year from\n        industry: invest in public resources and speed up government\n        processes. These palatable but inconsequential suggestions are just a\n        vehicle for the more important ones that I outlined above. Ben\n        Horowitz, Brad Smith, Marc Andreessen, and Satya Nadella want the\n        government to back off regulating this lucrative new development, let\n        industry decide what regulations are worth the trade-off, and nullify\n        copyright in a way that more or less acts as a general pardon for\n        illegal or unethical practices that many suspect enabled the rapid\n        rise of AI. Those are the policies that matter to them, whether kids\n        get digital literacy or not. SpaceX will attempt to transfer\n        propellant from one orbiting Starship to another as early as next\n        March, a technical milestone that will pave the way for an uncrewed\n        landing demonstration of a Starship on the moon, a NASA official said\n        this week. Much has been made of Starship’s potential to transform the\n        commercial space industry, but NASA is also hanging its hopes that the\n        vehicle will return humans to the moon under the Artemis program. The\n        space agency awarded the company a $4.05 billion contract for two\n        human-rated Starship vehicles, with the upper stage (also called\n        Starship) landing astronauts on the surface of the moon for the first\n        time since the Apollo era. The crewed landing is currently scheduled\n        for September 2026. Kent Chojnacki, deputy manager of NASA’s Human\n        Landing System program, provided more detail on exactly how the agency\n        is working with the space company as it looks toward that critical\n        mission in an interview with Spaceflight Now. It will come as no\n        surprise that NASA is paying close attention to Starship’s test\n        campaign, which has notched five launches so far. SpaceX made history\n        during the most recent test on October 13 when it caught the Super\n        Heavy rocket booster mid-air using “chopsticks” attached to the launch\n        tower for the first time. “We learn a lot each time [a launch]\n        happens,” Chojnacki said. Chojnacki’s work history includes numerous\n        roles in the Space Launch System program, which oversees the\n        development of a massive rocket of the same name that is being built\n        by a handful of traditional aerospace primes. The first SLS rocket\n        launched the Artemis I mission in December 2023, and future rockets\n        will launch the subsequent missions under the Artemis program. No part\n        of the rocket is reusable, however, so NASA is spending upwards of $2\n        billion on each launch vehicle. The first contracts for the SLS\n        program were awarded over a decade ago under what’s known as a\n        “cost-plus” model, which means that NASA pays a base amount plus\n        expenses. (This type of contract has been stringently criticized for\n        incentivizing long development timelines and high expenses.) In\n        contrast, HLS contracts are “fixed-price” — so SpaceX receives a\n        one-time $2.99 billion payment provided it meets certain milestones.\n        Chojnacki said NASA has taken very different approaches to the HLS\n        versus SLS program, even beyond the contracting model. “SLS was a very\n        traditional NASA program. NASA laid out a very strict set of\n        requirements and dictated propellant inventory, dictated all the\n        things to the various elements. They flowed down. They were cost-plus\n        programs where the aerospace companies would respond, and we would\n        work in a very traditional manner,” he said. “Moving to HLS, we’re\n        doing a lot of moving parts at one time. On SpaceX’s contract right\n        now, for their initial landing, there are 27 system requirements. 27,\n        and we kept it as loose as possible.” Under SpaceX’s contract, they\n        must meet mandatory design reviews, but SpaceX can also propose\n        additional milestones for payment. One requirement that SpaceX\n        requested is the ship-to-ship propellant transfer demonstration. Those\n        tests are set to begin around March 2025, with testing concluding in\n        the summer, Chojnacki said. “That would be the first time that’s\n        demonstrated on this scale, so that is a big building block. And once\n        you’ve done that, you’ve really cracked open the opportunity to move\n        massive amounts of payload and cargo outside of the Earth’s sphere. If\n        you can have a Starship with propellant aggregation, that’s going to\n        be the next step to doing an uncrewed demonstration.” In addition to\n        the testing, the next major review of Starship will be the Critical\n        Design Review (CDR) in Summer 2025, which is when NASA certifies that\n        the company met all 27 of those system requirements. Chojnacki said\n        NASA astronauts also meet with SpaceX once a month to provide input on\n        Starship’s interior. The company is building mockups of the crew\n        cabin, including the sleeping quarters and laboratory, at Boca Chica.\n        NASA anticipates getting a design update this month before looking at\n        it during the CDR next year. That isn’t the only place where NASA has\n        offered its input: it also offered input on some aspects of the rocket\n        design, like the vehicle’s cryogenic components, as well as conducting\n        some testing on the thermal tiles that help keep the cryogenic fuels\n        cold. If all goes to plan, SpaceX will land astronauts on the moon in\n        September 2026. “That is definitively the date we’re working towards.\n        We don’t have any known road blocks. We do have some first-time things\n        that have to be demonstrated, and we have a plan in place to go\n        demonstrate those.\n      ")])])}],o=(n("c5f6"),n("bc3a")),s=n.n(o),r=n("94df"),l=n.n(r),h=n("0c12"),c={data:function(){return{file:null,title:"",downloaded:!1}},filters:{humanBytes:function(e){return l()(Number(e))}},mounted:function(){var e=this;s.a.get("/api/files/".concat(this.$route.params.id)).then((function(t){var n=t.data;e.file=n,e.file.visitCount+=1,e.title="".concat(n.name," - ")})).catch((function(t){return console.log(t),500===t.response.status?h["a"].$emit("error","Server Error: Unable to handle the request now.
